# Coding evaluation
Your goal is to make this project functional by completing the `Hire()` method in the `Organization` class. You are free to change existing code or add additonal code, with the exception of `MyOrganization`. This file must not be changed.

## Running the project
This project should be run on a Visual Studio 2022 installation (Community Edition should be OK).

The `MyOrganization` class has the `main()` method, so the project can be run in the IDE with that class set for startup.
